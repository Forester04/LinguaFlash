# LinguaFlash

LinguaFlash is a mobile application built to help users memorize content using flashcards. Each user can create their own sets of flashcards to aid in learning. The application is designed to track user progress using a unique user ID assigned to them upon launching the app, making it possible to manage flashcard sets on a per-user basis.

- Future updates will include user authentication and deployment to make the app more accessible.

## Features

- Flashcard Creation: Users can create custom flashcards with questions and answers to enhance their memorization of various topics.
- User Tracking: A unique user ID is automatically generated for each user, allowing the app to track individual learning progress and store created flashcard sets.
- Set Management: Flashcard sets are saved under each user ID, so the next time the user opens the app, their sets will be available for continued learning.

## Technologies

- React Native: For building the mobile interface of the application.
- JavaScript & TypeScript: Primary programming languages used for both front-end and back-end functionality.
- Expo: Used for building, developing, and deploying the app.
- Git: For version control and collaboration.
- Node.js: Back-end environment to handle server-side operations.

## Future Development

- Authentication: A user authentication system will be implemented to allow users to log in securely and sync their flashcard data across devices.
- Deployment: The application will be deployed so users can access it directly from app stores.
